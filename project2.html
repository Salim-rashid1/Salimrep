        <p>During the Paleolithic Period, which lasts from the beginnings of human life until about 10,000 BCE, people were nomads
            .<br> lived in groups of 20 -30, and spent most of their time hunting and gathering.  In these groups, work was divided<br>
             between men and women, with the men hunting game animals, and women gathering fruits, berries,<br> and other edibles.
            These early peoples developed simple tools such as, spears and axes made from bone,<br> wood, and stone.  Human beings lived in
             this manner from earliest times until about 10,000 BCE, when they started to cultivate crops<br> and domesticate animals.
            This is known as the Neolithic Revolution. </p>
